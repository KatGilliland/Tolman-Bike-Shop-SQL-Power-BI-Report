# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project analyzes hourly sales data for the fictional Tolman Bike Shop. This project provides insights into Tolman Bike Shop's revenue, profit, and rider demographics over time. The report was created using SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for visualization. The goal of this project was to examine key profitability trends and explore the potential impact of a price increase on customer demand.

# KEY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
# What data is analyzed in this project?
The dataset included hourly sales figures across different days as well as customer demographics (casual customers vs. registered riders). Metrics such as revenue, profit, and the number of riders were tracked across two different years (2021 and 2022).

# What are the most profitable hours and days?
The most profitable hours were determined to be around midday (10 hours, 10:00 AM) and early evening (15 hours, 3:00 PM). Sales show a significant increase on Wednesdays and Fridays, indicating that these are the peak days for revenue.

# What tools and technologies did you use?
I used SQL for data extraction and transformation. I created a database in SQL Server Management Studio and wrote a SQL query highlighting the portion of the CSV file for Tolman Bike Shop in which I was looking to visualize and analyze. Once the query was written, I imported it into Power BI along with the database I created. Power BI was used to create visualizations and dashboards, as well as to analyze the data through interactive reports.

# What is the central question of the analysis?
The central question of the analysis was whether it would be possible to increase prices without losing profit, revenue, or demand.

# What was the result of the price increase analysis?
A 25% price increase led to a 64% increase in demand. Based on this trend, it appears Tolman Bike Shop could continue to raise their prices without significantly risking the loss of customers.

# What insights can be derived from the rider demographics?
The majority of bike riders/customers are registered users (81.17%), while casual riders make up only about 18.83% of the total. Understanding this ratio could assist with decision making when it comes to marketing and pricing strategies (i.e., offering discounts for casual riders to help increase customer conversion rate).

# What recommendations would you make based on this analysis?
Given the positive demand response to price increase in years past (2021 and 2022), it is my recommendation that the bike shop experiment with conservative incremental price increases.
